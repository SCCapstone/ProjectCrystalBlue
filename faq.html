        <h2>Terminology</h2>

        <h3 class="question">What is the difference between a "Source" and a "Sample"?</h3>
        <p>A source represents the physical rock that a geologist first collects in the field; that is, a collection of material collected from the same outcrop that is expected to be the same composition.  No matter what procedures are performed on the Source, it still has the same metadata (i.e. lithology, deposystem, age method, etc.).  A Sample represents any representative portion derived from the original Source.  A Sample simply tracks its location and the procedures it has undergone.  There may (and probably will) be several Samples derived from a single Source.</p>

        <h3 class="question">What is a procedure?</h3>
        <p>A procedure is any test or modification to collected material. Examples include separating magnetic material with an electromagnet, using a sieve to filter fine grains, or crushing a solid rock into smaller pieces.</p>

        <h2>Set Up</h2>

        <h3 class="question">How do I get started?</h3>
        <p>You can download the application on your Mac or iOS Device, click "skip" on the credentials screen, and immediately enter data to be stored locally. If you have existing data that you have managed with spreadsheet software (such as Microsoft Excel), you can export the data as a CSV file for import into PCB.</p>

        <h3 class="question">How do I enable cloud storage?</h3>
        <p>To enable cloud storage, you will need to have an Amazon Web Services account. Visit <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">aws.amazon.com</a>, and click on the Sign Up. Once there, you will need to click on the "Manage Credentials" dialog to acquire credentials for use in external applications (such as PCB). It is recommended that you rotate these credentials frequently for security reasons.</p>

        <h3 class="question">How much will cloud storage cost?</h3>
        <p>Most likely, for small labs, your storage will cost less than $10 dollars per month. See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/pricing/">SimpleDB</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Simple Storage Service</a> pages for up-to-date pricing information.
        </p>


        <h2>Other</h2>

        <h3 class="question">PCB is not working or my data is not syncing properly!</h3>
        <p>In the event that the application enters an unstable state, it may be necessary to clear your local data.  To do so, open the application and click Database->Clear Local Database in the menu.  This will close the application and reset all local data.  You can click sync or import a .csv to retreive your existing data.  <strong>NOTE: You will lose all unsynced data by performing this action. Data synced will be unaffected.</strong></p>
