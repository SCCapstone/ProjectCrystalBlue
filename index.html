        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Project Crystal Blue (PCB) is a Mac OSX and iOS application for geologists looking for a simple system to catalog, track, and analyze their geologic samples and data.  PCB was designed with geologists in mind and strives to reflect their workflow as best as possible.</p>
        <p>PCB can be run on a single machine or synchronized across multiple computers and iOS devices, has complete offline support, and includes importing existing collections from a .csv file.  From collecting data in the field to managing your growing collection to performing procedures in the lab, Project Crystal Blue is the one-stop management system that you have been looking for.</p>


        <!-- Collecting Samples Section -->
        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collecting Your Samples In The Field</h3>

        <p>Project Crystal Blue makes it easy to add new sources you have collected in the field with an easy, step-by-step walkthrough on the iOS application.  The walkthrough prompts you for information such as lithology, formations, and locality data and stores this data on your local device.  Additionally, PCB prefills GPS coordinates and other calculable data so you don't have to.  The walkthrough concludes with the ability to add related images directly from the camera or from stored images in your iOS device's gallery.</p>


        <!-- Synchronizing Section -->
        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Synchronizing With The Cloud</h3>

        <p>Because you may not have an Internet connection while working in the field, all of PCB's features are completely functional offline.  However, you may also collaborate with other geologists or you may simply want a safe and secure storage system for all your important data.  Project Crystal Blue provides this functionality in the best way possible.</p>
        <p>After collecting your sources in the field, you can easily synchronize your data across multiple computers and iOS devices.  Once an Internet connection has been established, your data can be stored in the cloud with just a simple click.  If multiple devices are working with your collection, PCB will intelligently determine how to handle inconsistencies in the data and update your collection accordingly.  You will never have to worry about data inconsistencies again!</p>


        <!-- Managing Collection Section -->
        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Your Collection</h3>

        <p>On all of your devices, PCB provides functionality to easily manage and analyze sources and samples in your collection.  With the iOS application, PCB makes searching for samples in the lab a snap by quickly scanning a QR code.  These QR codes can be generated and printed wirelessly through any of the devices with PCB installed.</p>
        <p>On the OSX application, you can quickly search your collection by typing in simple key words or through an advanced search window.  When looking over a source or sample, the detail panel provides a quick and easy way to read or edit the information you're looking for.  Finally PCB includes support for column sorting, bulk editing, and google maps integration for even more refinement.</p>


        <!-- Performing Procedures Section -->
        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performing Procedures On Your Samples</h3>

        <p>In the lab, PCB provides a number of common procedures that you can perform on your samples to replicate an actual geologist's workflow.  Performing a magnetic separation on your sample?  Simply select your sample, choose your procedure, and enter your initials. The sample will automatically be split into two samples representing the separation which occurred during the procedure.  Each of these samples will retain previous metadata and procedure information as they undergo procedures.  The detail panel even provides a quick, easy reference to check back on all the procedures the sample has undergone.</p>


        <!-- Import/Export Section -->
        <h3><a name="header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Importing and Exporting Collections</h3>

        <p>You want to get started with Project Crystal Blue but don't know how to move over your current collection?  Luckily, PCB supports importing and exporting .csv files directly in the application.  After setting up your .csv file as PCB expects, you can import your entire collection and immediately start taking advantage of all the features PCB has to offer. </p>
